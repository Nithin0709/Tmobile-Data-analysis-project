# Tmobile-Data-analysis-project
## Project objective
This project focuses on improving network reliability, performance efficiency, congestion handling, and operational continuity for a telecom provider (T-Mobile).
Using analytics, visualization, and data engineering methods, the project identifies patterns in speed, tower congestion, latency, uptime, weather impact, and usage behavior, enabling scalable optimization and decision-making.

The goal is to help T-Mobile:

✔ Reduce downtime
✔ Improve user experience
✔ Optimize tower utilization
✔ Increase network efficiency and health

## Dataset Used
"C:\Users\nithi\Desktop\Sigma folder\T mobile Project\data.csv"

## Dashboard & Insight Layers (Power BI)
The dashboard is designed as a real-time decision interface with four analytical modules:

Performance View

Shows download/upload speed patterns

Highlights high-efficiency/low-efficiency windows

Network Load & Reliability

Tracks tower usage levels, uptime, latency distribution

Identifies overloaded towers requiring capacity expansion

External & Environmental Factors

Weather impact vs network behavior comparison

Health score grading and risk categorization

Overall Insights & KPIs

Max users connected, efficiency index, downtime risk indicator

Peak vs Non-Peak utilization analysis

These insights help engineers detect issues before they escalate and allocate resources optimally.

## Final Outcome
A fully integrated analytics ecosystem capable of monitoring network health, measuring performance quality, predicting operational risks, and recommending enhancement strategies—contributing to a more stable, faster, and user-focused telecom network.
